# matrix-commander-rs
simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending and receiving

# Help create this Rust program!

This project is currently only a vision. The Python package matrix-commander
exists. See [matrix-commander](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander-rs/).
The vision is to have a compatible program in Rust. I cannot do it myself,
but I can coordinate and merge your pull requests. Have a look at the repo
[matrix-commander-rs](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander-rs/).
Please help! Please contribute code to make this vision a reality,
and to one day have a functional matrix-commander crate. Safe!

# What you can do

- Give a :star: on Github. The more stars on Github, the more people will
  see the project. Do it now, thanks. :clap:
- Talk about it to your friends, post it in chatrooms, Hacker News, etc.
  This will give exposure and help find people willing to provide code,
  contributions, and PRs.
- Write code yourself.

# Immediate action items
- long, long list

# Ideas
- Make it compatible with the Python version of `matrix-commander`, i.e.
  same config file, same CLI, etc. The user should be able to run
  the Python `matrix-commander` in the morning, and the Rust
  `matrix-commander` in the afternoon.
- Use similar modules as used in Python, e.g.
  [argparse](https://crates.io/crates/argparse).
- Use [matrix-rust-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk).
- Use [ruma](https://crates.io/crates/ruma) if and where needed.
- Have a look at this small example
  [matrix-send-rs](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk).
